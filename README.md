# Sustainable Optimized Links for Alternative Commuting Experience
Our project is an integrated transportation solution that combines e-rickshaw and 
e-cycle management into a single mobile application. Built with Firebase for backend 
services, the app ensures real-time data synchronization, authentication, and efficient 
performance. The solution emphasizes user convenience, eco-friendliness, and system 
security, catering primarily to students.
